# Local Setup

## Prerequisites
Must be able to run application with a role that is able to assume ```ASSUMED_ROLE_NAME```
with proper permissions to create report.

Since trusted advisor must be told to refresh its values, the script
limits-refresh.py must be run some time in advance of the limits collection.
Generally, 1 hour before hand is a safe value, but your mileage may vary.

Aphelion expect to find AWS credentials through the normal client/SDK
discovery mechanisms (instance profile, .aws/credentials file, ENV variables, 
etc), and the principal linked to those credentials must be able to assume a
role in each target account. Those target role names must be identical in each
target account. That target role must have permissions necessary to list or
describe the resources that are being inspected, as well as issue a TA refresh
and get a TA report.

Aphelion requires AWS Premium Support Subscription in order to programmatically call [AWS trusted advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/).

## Configure
Aphelion requires the following properties to be set in order to run.
